# Airflow_stocks_ETL_Project
Designed and orchestrated an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow, Python and AWS S3 to get the understanding of
Airflow and its working procedure.<br>
In this project I used a stock api to fetch top 30 stocks details from Nasdaq, made some transformation on them and
store the whole data into S3 bucket.<br>
The whole ETL process was scheduled using airflow dags.

## Tools Used
Python<br>
